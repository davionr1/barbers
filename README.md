This is a website where clients can book a barber for them or buy the various clippers we have in stock

brainstorming my approach:
    backend:

    find pictures of clippers, barbers, and find images of cut hair with a description on those specific cuts.

    send them in the db with their contact info.
    
    frontend: 

    home screen page.

    navbar for clippers and barbers with their clients cuts on display and appointement availablities.

    ability to rate the barbers and or leave a review if the client has been with the barber.

    ADMIN:
    there is going to be a code in the search bar to put so the admin can acess the admin section of the site
    where they can add more clippers to their supply in the db and add or delete a barber.
     
    BARBER:
    the barber will sign in with a role of barber, which they canadjust their working hours, 
    view their appointments, and edit their picture

    NOTIFICATION:
    when users set an appointment, they and the barber will receive a noti and until the user 
    goes to get the cut, the users app in the schedule will clear.
    Admin gets notis when supplies are low or barber deletes their profile(quits).
    users receive a noti when they buy a item and will show how long it will take to get to their location 
    dependant on the (business location)

    PAYMENT:
    accepts payments for items or barbers
